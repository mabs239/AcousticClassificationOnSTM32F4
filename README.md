# AcousticClassificationOnSTM32F4
STM32F4 Discovery with STM32f407VG is used to record the sound event and classify it into gunshot and non-gunshot events. The code extracts the acoustic features such as Zero Crossing Rate, Short Time Energy, Energy Entropy, Spectral Rolloff, Spectral Flux etc. Next the features are passed through Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. 

# Note
Currently development is being done on previously created repository one-node.
